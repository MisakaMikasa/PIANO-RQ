# PIANO (or DISCO)
This is a user friendly python implementation of DISCO: Influence Maximization Meets Network Embedding and Deep Learning (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07378).

Due to an reorganization of files however, to run the codes right now, it is necessary to change file paths in the training and testing files.

## Training
Run train_both file and replace relevant paths in DDPG and DQN.

## Testing
Run Agent_test and replace relevant model and file paths.

## Graph Dataset:
Internet Peer-to-peer graphs from SNAP dataset.
